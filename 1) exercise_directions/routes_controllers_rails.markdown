## Routes and Controllers in Rails

Today we talked about

* the `routes.rb` file in Rails
* the purpose of a controller in Rails
* how to use `resources :things` to create eight RESTful routes

### Your Task

Reading

* [Rails Routing](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html)

Create a new rails project: 

```
$ rails new routes-controllers-practice
$ cd routes-controllers-practice
$ bundle
```

1) Add this route in your `routes.rb` file: 

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get '/students', to: 'students#index'
end
```

Add a controller and a method within that controller that renders the text: "You've hit the students index page."

2) Modify your routes file:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get '/students', to: 'students#index'
  resources :courses
end
```

Add a controller and all methods that the controller will need in order to use the routes generated by this. Don't worry about rendering text. Just make sure you have (empty) methods defined. 

3) Modify your routes file:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get '/students', to: 'students#index'
  resources :courses
  resources :teachers
end
```

Can you add something to the end of the `resources :teachers` line in order to only create the `show` and `index` routes instead of all eight routes generated by `resources`? 

4) Add a root path so that we can navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. Have this route go to the `index` action in a welcome controller. 

Extensions:

1) With `resources :teachers` you typically access a single teacher with a numeric ID like `/teachers/6`. Can you make it so their last name is used instead of the numeric ID (like `teachers/warbelow`)? Use [this blog post](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/rails-patch-change-the-name-of-the-id-parameter-in) for help.

2) What does the following piece of code do? How do you have to modify your controllers in order to access these routes?

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :school do
    resources :teachers
  end
end
```
